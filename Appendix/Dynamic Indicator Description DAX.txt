Decisions certainly can reflect government wishes without 'merely reflectin' those wishes, i.e. a court can be autonomous when its decisions support the government’s position. This is because a court can be fairly persuaded that the government’s position is meritorious. By 'merely reflect the wishes of the government' we mean that the court’s own view of the record, its sincere evaluation of the record, is irrelevant to the outcome.
